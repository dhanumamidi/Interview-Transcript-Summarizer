Jason, from Boise, Idaho, and two other interviewees from Frankfort, Kentucky, discussed their financial situation during an interview. Jason and his wife have two children (8 year old girl and 5 year old boy) and have recently paid off their mortgage with an inheritance. They have a household income of 115K before taxes and 95K after taxes, and no liabilities except for a student loan of $5K. They have a 401K balance of $112,000, a wife's IRA, stocks worth $500,000, and a property in Idaho worth nearly a million dollars. They discussed the importance of planning for retirement and maximizing their assets, and the need to hire a professional to ensure they are doing things correctly. Jason's FICO score is 780 and he is currently contributing 7% to his 401K, with an employer match of up to 5k per year. Shawn then introduced a product which provides a cash advance to maximize the 401K match, with a credit limit of $9,000 and a $10 monthly fee. The interest rate would be 3-4% lower than a credit card and payments would be a minimum of 5-10% of the balance. Jason was interested in the product and was reassured by the fact that his 401K would still be making money. The best way to market to someone like Jason is through mail, Facebook, Google, and social ads.
