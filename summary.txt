Jason and his wife are 53 years old and live in Boise, Idaho with their two children. They have a household income of $155,000 after taxes, no credit card debt or mortgage, and recently paid off their mortgage in full. Jason has a 401K with a balance of $112,000 and his wife has an IRA worth approximately $100,000. They have stocks from Microsoft worth approximately $500,000 and a home valued at $650,000. They recently received an inheritance of $75,000 in cash and property from a cousin's death, which they used to pay off bills and plan to put into a 529 for their children's college education. Jason and his wife plan to retire in their late 60s and are looking to hire a financial planner to help them maximize their assets and plan for retirement. Jason's FICO score is 780 and they are currently putting 7% of their income into their 401K, but are considering increasing it to 15% in the new year. Shawn's company is considering providing a cash advance to Jason to help him maximize his 401K contributions, which would be a revolving loan with a fee of $10 per month, plus interest charges on the balance, with an interest rate 3-4% lower than credit card rates and a minimum payment of 5-10% of the balance.
